This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Getting Started

## Setup .env.local

Get the Solana API key from [Moralis admin page](https://admin.moralis.io/web3apis)

Rename the .env.local.example to .env.local and add the required API and NFT secrets.

## Install Packages

Run yarn install to install the packages

```bash
yarn
or
yarn install
```

## Start local server

Run the development server in port 8000 as the `NEXTAUTH_URL` in env.local file is set to this port. Can be updated to the required port.

```bash
yarn run dev -p 8000
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the result.
